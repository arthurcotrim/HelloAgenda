# HelloAgenda

This is an application that will vbe to add some ToDo's to your personal agenda.

The storage is not connected with back-end, however I'm using Javascript to storage the data, but it'll be simple, so don't work with the intention of keep the data for too long,
but it will work well.

Here we are using HTML, CSS and JS to build the application.
